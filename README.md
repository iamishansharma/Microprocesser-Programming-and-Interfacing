# Microprocesser-Programming-and-Interfacing
  
  This repository contains project for Microprocesser-Programming-and-Interfacing (CS F241) at BITS Pilani, Spring 2019.
  
## Project Problem Statment: 

   Design a microprocessor based EPROM Programmer to program 2716 and 2764.The EPROM can be programmed by applying 25V at VPP and 5V at OE pin. Initially all data of EPROM will be 1â€™s and the user should make the bits zero selectively. Before the EPROM location is programmed it must be checked for whether it is empty (data in location must be FFH if the location is empty) The 8- bit parallel data is applied to the data pins of EPROM. The address for the EPROM is to be provided. To program the address of each location to be programmed should be stable for 45ms.When address and data are stable, a 40ms active high pulse is applied to CE input. After the EPROM is programmed, IC number is to be displayed on LCD as "27xy programmed".
